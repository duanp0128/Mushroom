Mushroom
========
“MushroomAndBear” is my console game and the demo is here http://youtu.be/1gchxv896eg.


Game Description
------
“MushroomAndBear” is my console game. It comes from the famous game “Breakout”. Player can control a plate and let the 
ball hit plate and bounce higher into blocks in top. This is a very classic and funny game. In my game, I make some 
innovation and make the UI seems more lovely and interesting. I change the plate into a mushroom, the ball into a cute 
bear and the blocks into some interesting plants(e.g., leaf, flower, acorn). The game rule is similar like “Breakout”: 
player operates the mushroom and uses it to bounce bear into plants in top. When all plants are clear, the player wins 
the game, or when player lost all lives, the game will be over.
